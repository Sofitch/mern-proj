# MERN Stack Tutorial

## What is MERN?

The MERN stack is 4 technologies that we can use together to make an interactive data driven application.

- On the frontend we have the browser. Our React app runs in the browser and typically also handles routing in the browser.

- To show data or authenticate users, we send a request to the backend. The backend is an Express app running in a Node Js environment, which interacts with the database to get or update data.
    - Express is a framework for Node to facilitate creating APIs

- MongoDB is a noSLQ database

## First steps

- Install NodeJS from nodejs.org
